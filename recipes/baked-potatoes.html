    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Serves 2-4</h3>
    <p>Get perfect baked potatoes with a crispy skin and a fluffy interior every time!</p>
    <p>This also works well in a toaster oven or air fryer!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 russet potatoes</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil (use one suitable for high heat, like grapeseed, canola, or avocado)</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Optional toppings: butter, sour cream, chives, smoked salmon, bacon, cheese, broccoli, chili.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat oven to 450&deg; (about 232&deg; C) or your air fryer to 400&deg; F (about 205&deg; C)).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, rub each potato with oil and sprinkle evenly with salt.</li>
        <li>Place the potatoes on a wire rack over a baking sheet, or directly onto your toaster oven rack or air fryer basket. </li>
        <li>Bake until the skin is crispy and the interior is soft, 45-60 minutes in an oven or toaster oven or 35-45 minutes in an air fryer. When the potato is done, it will "give" when squeezed gently, or read 205-210&deg; F (about 96-99&deg; C) on an instant-read thermometer.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and cut open immediately to allow steam to escape.</li>
        <li>Serve with your favorite toppings.</li>
    </ol>
