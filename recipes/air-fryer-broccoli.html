    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Serves 2-4</h3>
    <p>Roasting broccoli gives it a sweet and complex flavor, and this three-ingredient recipe comes together in minutes.</p>
    <p>For more punch, sprinkle generiously with spices before roasting.  My favorites are garlic powder, red pepper flakes, and cajun seasoning.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large broccoli crown, chopped into equally-sized florets</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat air fryer to 400&deg; F (about 205&deg; C).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, drizzle the broccoli with olive oil, sprinkle with salt, and toss to coat evenly.</li>
        <li>Once the air fryer has pre-heated, add the broccoli, and set timer for 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cook, tossing the basket or turning the pieces once or twice.  If some pieces are getting dark, move them towards the center of the basket or remove them early.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat, and add the stuffing mix.  Stir to combine.  If it still feels dry, gradually add extra stock or water.</li>
        <li>Add additional salt to taste, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
