    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Serves 4</h3>
    <p>An easy recipe with Thanksgiving flavors in just a few minutes.  Serve with cranberry sauce or lingonberry jam.</p>
    <p>Works great with turkey or pork, but make sure your mix has some fat.  If you use all white meat, add an extra Tbsp or two of butter, or it will be dry. </p>
    <p>You can also make this with leftover prepared stuffing:  break it up with your hands, then proceed to Step 8.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp plus 1 tsp butter, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp dried thyme</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp dried rosemary</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp dried sage</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground pepper</li>
        <li>3/4 cup chicken or vegetable stock (salted to taste)</li>
        <li>2 cups stuffing mix or dry bread cubes</li>
        <li>1 lb ground turkey (dark meat or 50/50) or pork</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt 1 Tbsp butter in a skillet on medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the onions and sautee until golden.</li>
        <li>Add the herbs and spices and sautee until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add the stock and bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat, and add the stuffing mix.  Stir to combine.  If it still feels dry, gradually add extra stock or water.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a large mixing bowl, and allow the stuffing to cool enough to handle.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, wash the skillet.</li>
        <li>Add the ground meat and mix roughly.</li>
        <li>Form into four equal patties.  Press slightly in the center on both sides to create an indentation.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining 1 tsp butter in the skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the patties, and cook, turning once, until both sides are browned and the internal temperature reaches 155&deg; F (about 69&deg; C).</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and allow to rest for 3 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
